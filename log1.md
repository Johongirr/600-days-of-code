### What is neuroplasticity?
Neuroplasticity is change in the brain that happens when we learn new motor skill or fact

### How brain support learning
Brain can change in 3 basic ways to support learning
1.FACT: Chemical - it is that brain works by transforming chemical signals between brain cell what we call neurons. and this cause a series of actions and reactions between brain cells. So to support learning brain increase the amount of concentrations of these chemical signalling that's taking place between neurons. Because this changes happen very quickly, this support short-term memory or the short-term improvement of a motor skill.
EXAMPLE: For example, in a single session of practise you get better and better at chess, tennis, programming but when you return to do those things tomorrow all improvements from day before are gone. So what happened here is the brain increases chemical signalling between neurons, and this is for short-term

2. Altering by its structure - The second way that the brain change to support learning is by altering its structure. So during learning, the brain
can change connections between neurons. So in here physical structure of the brain actually changes . So this kind of changes reflect in long-term memory or the long-term improvement in a motor skill. And to achieve long term memory we have to practise constantly. Structural changes also can lead to integrated networks of brain regions that work together to support learning. And they can also lead to certain brain regions that are important for very specific behaviours to change your brain structure or to enlarge. the best driver of neuroplastic change in your brain is your behaviour.
The problem is that the dose of behaviour, the dose of practice that's required to learn new and relearn old motor skills, is very large.

3. Altering its function - The last way that your brain can change to support learning is by altering its function. As you use a brain region, It becomes more and more excitable and easy to use again. And as your brain has these areas that increase their excitability, the brain shifts how and when they are activated. With learning, we see that whole networks of brain activity are shifting and changing.
So neuroplasticity is supported by chemical, by structural, and by functional changes, and these are happening across the whole brain.
They can occur in isolation from one another, but most often, they take place in concert. Together, they support learning. And they're taking place all the time. And that's how awesomely neuroplastic your brain is.

### Visualization technique
#### What is visualization?
Visualization is a technique that use imagination like achieving certain goal, becoming person we want to be, and thinking the moments how we feel when we will be the person that we always be or achieve goal we always want to achieve.

#### Reticular activation system
Reticular activation is small region of brain that's gatekeeper of information that's let into our conscious mind. RAS filters huge amounts of information that our sensory organs (apart from smell) generating  and selects information that's most important for conscious mind pays attention to  and throw out unnecessary information.
If RAS accepts all information our sensory organs generate our mind would've melt down and our head burst. We as humans are in charge of what information RAS should let into our conscious mind.

#### Does our brain spot difference between rela and unreal(imaginery) memories?
Scientifically speaking, our brain does experience what we did in real life, real memories and  what we imagined, false memories as the same thing.
So that's why we have to always be and think positive. Whatever we think positive or negative about ourselves or people, things around us, by doings so we order RAS let these thoughts into our brain and our brain to look for evidence for those things around our environment. 
So we have to be careful about what we think.

#### How to use visualization 
If your goal is to be a google programmer,  visualize what your life looks life and  how your are going to feel about yourself, when you become a google programmer There are 2 things that you have to do when it comes to visualization
1. Close your eyes and in your mind have specific pictures of what it looks like in your life

    when you'll become a google programmer. you r going to be financially free, you r going to buy new house to your parents, you are going to build masjid, donate to people, and help people in need

2. When you start to visualize images of that, consciously think of positive emotions that you 

    are going to feel, I'm going to feel fulfilled, I'm going to feel happy, I'm going to be proud

    I'm going to be so grateful that I made this change

Mirroring  the specific picture oh there am, I am at google communicating with my colleagues, there I am giving lecture, there I am becoming senior developer at google, there I am celebrating my first 1 million dollar revenue.
When you do that cool science part is happening you are training your brain to have a totally different RAS(filter). Our brain does not know difference between what real thing happened to you, real memories and what you imagine, your imaginations. imagined memories.
Your brain will experience you visualizing  you'll become a google programmer. you r going to be financially free, you r going to buy new house to your parents, you are going to build masjid, donate to people, and help people in need
Your brain, when u visualize (step1, step2) encodes  it as a real memory. 
What studies suggest and have proven is that simply visualizing yourself doing things, actually develops the skill. Helps you improve skill just as if you were actually doing it.
Then finally the other thing that's really important about this Is that the more that you do this what we know based on research? Is that the reason why you start to believe what you think is because you are reprogramming your brain you are changing the
network of neurons that act as a filter and so the more that you actually believe In yourself and you start thinking and visualizing yourself speaking up the more confident
you're going to become the more skills that you're building and you're actually going to do it Every morning after you wake do visualization in goal that you are want to achieve.
