## 100 Days of Code

### Day 1: Dec 4, 2020

#### Introduction
So actually I've started 600 days of code challenge for about 2 weeks and I'm also starting to keep journal of my progress each day. I'm going to write about what new I've learned today and what were the challenges that i could solve. So hopefully this challenge keeps me accounted for the upcoming NOWS. So let's rock it

#### What I've learned so far
So i've learned algorithms, memory, and nowdays I'm learning data structures and today i've learned about singly linked lists


### Day 2: Dec 5, 2020

#### Things I've learned
Today I've learned about Doubly Linked List Which data structure that consists of Nodes And Each node in the list connected with each other via pointers(links, references) unlike Singly Linked List, nodes in DLL has knows address of both node next to it and node before it.

#### Advantages of DLL over SLL
While removing last node is O(n) in DLL it is constant because of nodes in DLL has previous and next pointers but in SLL has only next pointer which points node after it, so you can just make second to last node tail which is constant time O(1)

You can loop through both forward and backwards in DLL but in only left to right 

#### Disadvantages of DLL over SLL
As nodes in DLL use two pointers and data while in SLL only uses data and a single pointer, that's why DLL require more memory than SLL

#### Resource
I've been learning Algorithms and Data Structures Which is the course of Colt Steele. And I'm very satisfied with his course for it contains not only theortical explanations of topics but also practical exercies
