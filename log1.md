## 100 Days of Code

### Dec 4, 2020

#### Introduction
So actually I've started 600 days of code challenge for about 2 weeks and I'm also starting to keep journal of my progress each day. I'm going to write about what new I've learned today and what were the challenges that i could solve. So hopefully this challenge keeps me accounted for the upcoming NOWS. So let's rock it

#### What I've learned so far
So i've learned algorithms, memory, and nowdays I'm learning data structures and today i've learned about singly linked lists
